# Team Rocket Pokemon Social Media Application
A social-media application aimed towards Pokemon trainers that allows users to interact with other trainers and create a sense of community through a social media platform. This application will allow trainers to create and share posts,
create a team of Pokemon based off of Pokemon that have been captured, propose potential trades, and will use a "follow" system for each user to expand their social circle among the Pokemon fanbase. Other key features include a search
function that utilizes PokeAPI to allow users to filter and search for Pokemon based off of a given criteria, and users will be suggested other users to follow based on how geographically close they are to others using Google's
Geocoding API.
